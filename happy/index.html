        <p>Let’s start with a quote. Buddhism teaches that “the root of all suffering is desire”. To have desires is to suffer is to be unhappy - but how does that help anyone? Should one just stop desiring?</p>
<p>Alan Watts, an illustrious zen philosopher, converts these ideas into a simple philosophy on how to live:</p>
<p>“The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple, and yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.”</p>
<p>Everyone you know will have a new year’s resolution. Goals are, by definition, are a desire but, at the same time, goals are also an invaluable tool for orienting yourself in the world. So, how do you reconcile the pain of desire with the benefits of goals?</p>
<p>It is vital to remember that there is always something else on the to-do list and there is always more you could have accomplished in a day. Of course, you could have been less distracted or eaten healthier, but even if you had done that, you’d still be telling yourself the same thing just in a different way. We are constantly striving for something ‘greater’ than ourselves.</p>
<p>This is not all bad, there is value here. Suffering breeds strength and desires can propel you towards greater things. I do believe a desire can be so important that it’s worth being unhappy until the goal is satisfied.</p>
