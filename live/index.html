        <p>Theory 1:
Mental toughness is your ability to see the positive in every situation. This is because the alternative is a destructive spiral to the bottom of society. Binge watched two episodes of Netflix when you said you would sleep after one?  Choice one: That&rsquo;s ok, let me sleep now, at least I enjoyed it. Choice two: I&rsquo;ve ruined everything, I&rsquo;m going to wake up tired, I may aswell just keep watching.</p>
<p>Theory 2:
Be equanimous. Nothing is necesarily good or bad. It simply is. Cease to label sensations you feel. You feel cold and that&rsquo;s bad. Nope it&rsquo;s just tingling on your skin. You win the lottery! Great! Nope, you have a much higher chance of dying from cocaine overdose. You break your arm because someone crashed into you. Horrible! Nope, you have a new lease of life because you had a near-death experience. Nothing is good or bad. In the moment, give everything you have to achieve the goal and afterwards, equanimity.</p>
<p>Theory 3:
Intention vs Attachment. I want to become financially free. This is a desire I have chosen. Desire is a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want, and I think this desire is worth the unhappiness. However I need to stop being attached, be equanimous. It is not necesarily good or bad to achieve it. But my intention is still directed there.  My intention is to suceed but it can come from a positive place rather than a negative fear-centred, attatchemnt plcae.</p>
<p>You need to be able to see the good in everything or do you need to be able to see the good and bad in everything?</p>
